description: ReadMe is a developer hub for your startup or code. Its a completely
  customizable and collaborative place for documentation, support, key generation
  and more. Dont waste your precious time reimplementing a dev.yourstartup.com. If
  you have an API, code library, or affiliate program, documentation is hard. Users
  cant use your product without understanding it, and most documentation on the Internet
  is lacking. The goal of ReadMe is to make consuming APIs completely painless.
